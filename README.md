# fairness-mia

Experiments.ipynb is our main file which contains our fairness interventions and the subsequent membership inference attacks and analysis. We call functions from the mia folder, which contain some of the utils / functions that we use for doing the attack and measuring privacy risk. Much of the MIA folder is derived from Song et al. The fairness folder contains the preprocessing code (derived from Friedler et al.) and the preprocessed data (fairness/data/preprocessed/adult_numerical.csv).
